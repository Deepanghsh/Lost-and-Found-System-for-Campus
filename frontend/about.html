                    <h2>The Disconnected Search</h2>
                    <p>University and college campuses are large, bustling environments where personal belongings are frequently misplaced. I noticed that the old methods just weren't working. We all relied on a patchwork of solutions that led to more frustration than results.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Physical Notice Boards:</b> Static, easily cluttered, and offered no real-time updates.</li>
                        <li><b>Social Media Groups:</b> Prone to spam, where important posts get buried in minutes.</li>
                        <li><b>A Central Lost & Found Office:</b> Often inconvenient with limited hours and manual tracking.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p>This lack of a centralized, technology-driven system creates unnecessary stress and a low recovery rate for lost items. I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
